# **Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project aims to build a **machine learning-based predictive model** to detect breast cancer by classifying tumors as **benign or malignant**. The model utilizes **feature selection, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning** to enhance accuracy. The goal is to develop a robust and interpretable model that can assist in early detection, improving patient outcomes and treatment efficiency.

## **Dataset**
- The dataset used is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- It contains **569 instances and 30 feature variables**, including **mean radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, symmetry**, etc.
- The target variable is **Diagnosis**: **0 for benign, 1 for malignant**.
- The dataset is well-structured and contains minimal missing values, making it suitable for predictive modeling.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Deployment:** Flask (for API integration)
- **Visualization Tools:** Seaborn, Matplotlib (for EDA)

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Removing duplicate and irrelevant features
   - Encoding categorical variables (if applicable)
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing feature correlations using heatmaps
   - Identifying key statistical trends in malignant vs. benign cases
   - Box plots, histograms, and violin plots for feature distribution analysis
   
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Splitting dataset into **train-test sets (80-20 split)**
   - Training multiple classifiers and comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Fine-tuning models using **GridSearchCV** for optimal hyperparameter selection
   
4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC Curve**
   - Confusion Matrix visualization to analyze false positives and negatives

## **Results**
- Achieved **96% accuracy** using **Random Forest Classifier**.
- **Feature importance analysis** showed that **mean radius, texture, and smoothness** were key predictors of malignancy.
- The **ROC-AUC score of 0.98** indicated a highly reliable classification model.
- The model successfully minimizes false negatives, ensuring early cancer detection.
